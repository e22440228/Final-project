# Final project
 For my class final.

In this project, my difficulties are I can't use my normal ways to write my code because Discord has its own rules. I spend a lot of time on research and practice. However, I still have some problems that can't be finished.
First, I haven't solved only add reactions on Embed. I have been searched many websites, but I still can't figure it out.
Second, I can't find the most effective way to present my game.
Third, I failed to create DND. I spent too much time on my bot.
However, I still learn a lot from this project. I know how the real world works while I created my bot. It is much different than we learned in the class. I was very excited when my bot worked.

In summary, I am pretty like this assignment, but next time, I think I should find other people working with me. It has too much work if I work alone.
